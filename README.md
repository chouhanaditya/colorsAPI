# colorsAPI
This is a demo API which performs CRUD operations in attached sample colors.JSON file. This is just a dummy API which I created to
practice below things-

1) Perform CRUD operations on JSON data.
2) Enabled Swagger for this API.
3) API demonstrates ideal repository pattern architecture.
4) Added Docker support and docker image is uploaded on the Docker Hub.
5) Implemented ELK logging using Serilog.

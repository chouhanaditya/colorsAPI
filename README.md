# colorsAPI
This is a demo API which performs CRUD operations in attached sample colors.JSON file. This is just a dummy API which I created to
practice below things-

1) Perform CRUD operations with JSON in an ASP Core API
2) Added Swagger to this API.
3) API demonstrates ideal repository layer architecture.
4) Added Docker support and docker image is uploaded on the Docker Hub.
5) Implemented ELK logging using Serilog
